    "# CMSE 202 Midterm (Section 001 - Spring 2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this midterm is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed thus far this semester. In particular, you'll practice setting up a GitHub repository, committing and pushing repository changes, downloading data with command line tools, writing a python class, and using a new-to-you Python package. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam with even just eight weeks of CMSE 202 under your belt!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam. Once you've read through it, try doing Parts 1 and 2 first so that you have your repository set up and you download the provided data files as they will be necessary to complete the assigned tasks. Let your instructor know right away if you have problems downloading the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam is set up so that even if you get stuck on one part there are opportunities to get points on the other parts, so consider jumping ahead if you feel like you aren't making progress and then come back later if you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about using online resources**: This exam is \"open internet\". That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However**: The use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable. If you are seen accessing your email, using a chat program (e.g. Slack), or any sort of collaborative cloud storage or document software (e.g. Google Documents), you will be at risk for receiving a zero on the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep your eye on your screen!** Unfortunately, there isn't enough space in the room for everyone to sit at their own table so please do your best to keep your eyes on your own screen. If any of the instructors observe suspicious behavior, you will, again, risk receiving a zero."

    "1. Set up a new **private** Git repository on GitHub.\n",
    "2. Clone the repository onto your computer.\n",
    "3. Move this notebook into that repository and then add it and commit it to the repository and push the changes to the remote repository (**Suggestion**: You may want save and close this notebook before you move to the repository and then reopen it after you move it to make sure that you're working with the right copy of the notebook.)\n",
    "4. Add your instructor as a Collaborator to your respository. As a reminder, your instructor's username is: devinsilvia\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you're struggling with getting the Git repository set up, you can always just work on the notebook as is and try to come back and figure out the repository component later. You may lose some points though since you won't have periodic commits as you make progress along the way, but it will be better than not working on the other parts of the exam!"
